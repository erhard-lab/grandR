Glossary

  - Column: The entity for which parameters (read counts, NTR) are computed by GRAND-SLAM. This is either one of the \emph{samples} (usually: a sequencing library) in normal SLAM-seq, or a \emph{cell} in scSLAM-seq
  - Condition: A user-defined biologically meaningful stratification of columns 
  
  - Slot: Contains particular values (read counts, NTRs, normalized read counts, etc.) per column and gene
  - Mode: Either \emph{total}, \emph{new} or \emph{old}
  - Analysis: A set of results from a particular analysis tool (kinetic parameters, differential expression fold changes/p values, etc.) per gene
  
  - NTR: New-to-total RNA ratio, the central parameter that is estimated per gene and column by GRAND-SLAM.
