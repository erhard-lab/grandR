get rid of accessing the inner of the data structure
document all functions, use export and get rid of exporting everything (pay attention to S3Export)
toxicity (sars) -> vignette
differential expression testing (simulation about being more sensitive for short term changes, simulation about changed synthesis or degradation; real data)
kinetics (simulation, three fits (show unbiased), show deviation + CI; SARS data, show rmse; NXF1 data, lets see; llr test, sars and nxf1)
Test R version 3 and 4!
Add testing (at least for loading the example data and checking some things including whether coldata consists of factors etc)
