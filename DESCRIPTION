Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Nucleotide Conversion Sequencing Data
Description: Nucleotide conversion sequencing experiments have been
  developed to add a temporal dimension to RNA-seq and single-cell RNA seq. Such 
  experiments require specialized tools for primary processing such as GRAND-SLAM,
  and specialized tools for downstream analyses. grandR provides a comprehensive toolbox
  for quality control, kinetic modeling, differential gene expression analysis
  and visualization of such data.
