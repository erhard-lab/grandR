# grandR
Metabolic RNA labeling - nucleotide conversion experiments have been
  developed to add a temporal dimension to RNA-seq and single-cell RNA seq. Such 
  experiments require specialized tools for primary processing such as GRAND-SLAM,
  and specialized tools for downstream analyses. grandR provides a comprehensive toolbox
  for quality control, kinetic modeling, differential gene expression analysis
  and visualization of such data.

## How to get started

Install the R package using the following commands on the R console:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("erhard-lab/grandR")
library(grandR)
```
